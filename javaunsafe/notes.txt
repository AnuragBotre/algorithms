Usertype
User Types and classes for use with Hibernate. Includes user types for use with the javax.time classes included in the early review class of JSR 310. Where possible these types are compatible with the equivalent Joda Time - Hibernate user types.
User Types includes user types for Joda Time. These are designed for interoperability wherever possible with the provided JSR 310 user types. These can be used as an alternative to Joda Time Contrib's persistent types. The motivation for creating these types is the original types are affected by an issue whereby the written time is offset by the user's offset from the database zone.
User Type includes other user types - for enums, JDK types and Libphonenum.

Java Magic. Part 4: sun.misc.Unsafe
Java is a safe programming language and prevents programmer
from doing a lot of stupid mistakes, most of which based on memory management.
But, there is a way to do such mistakes intentionally, using Unsafe class.
