- This plug-in was inspired by the extJS border-layout, and recreates that
functionality as a jQuery plug-in.
The UI Layout plug-in can create any UI look you want - from simple headers or sidebars,
to a complex application with toolbars, menus, help-panels, status bars, sub-forms, etc.

-  If you've used Apache POI in the past to read in Excel files, you probably noticed that it's not very memory efficient. Reading in an entire workbook will cause a severe memory usage spike, which can wreak havoc on a server.


https://github.com/gk-brown/HTTP-RPC
-HTTP-RPC is an open-source framework for implementing and interacting with RESTful and REST-like web services in Java. It is extremely lightweight and requires only a Java runtime environment and a servlet container. The entire framework is distributed as a single JAR file that is less than 70KB in size, making it an ideal choice for applications where a minimal footprint is desired.

https://github.com/square/javapoet
        - JavaPoet is a Java API for generating .java source files.

        - Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as annotation processing or interacting with metadata files
                (e.g., database schemas, protocol formats).
                By generating code, you eliminate the need to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the metadata.

Refactoring Towards a Layered Architecture
        In this paper we present how refactoring of object-oriented programs can be accomplished by
        using formal refinement. Our approach is based on the use of refactoring rules designed for a
        sequential object-oriented language of refinement (rool) similar to Java. We define a strategy
        that aims at structuring programs according to a layered architecture that involves the application
        of refactoring rules, object-oriented programming laws, and data and algorithm refinement. As the
        laws are proved in a weakest precondition semantics of rool, correctness of refactoring is ensured
        by construction.
