- Sample SAML implementation for Java application
- This project contains a simple SAML implementation for a java spring boot application
- Setting up IDP
- Create an application corresponding to this test application in your IDP (ssoCircle/Okta/Onelogin).
- Environment variables
- APP_ID=<"APP ID from IDP">
- ENTITY_ID=<"ENTITY ID FROM IDP">
- IDP_METADATA_URL=<"METADATA URL for IDP">
- Running the application
    Start the SAMLApplication class and hit localhost:8443.
    You will be taken to your IDP and back to the index page once you provide valid login credentials.
    You can logout from the link provided in the index page.

- This manual describes Spring Security SAML Extension component, its uses, installation, configuration, design and integration possibilities.
- The extension enables both new and existing applications to act as a Service Provider in federations based on Web Single Sign-On and
- Single Logout profiles of SAML 2.0 protocol. The extension allows seamless combination of SAML 2.0
- and other authentication and federation mechanisms in a single application.
- All products supporting SAML 2.0 in Identity Provider mode (e.g. ADFS, Okta, Shibboleth, OpenAM, Efecte EIM or Ping Federate) can be used with the extension.

-HTTP-RPC is an open-source framework for implementing and interacting with RESTful and REST-like web services in Java. It is extremely lightweight and requires only a Java runtime environment and a servlet container. The entire framework is distributed as a single JAR file that is less than 70KB in size, making it an ideal choice for applications where a minimal footprint is desired.

        - JavaPoet is a Java API for generating .java source files.

        - Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as annotation processing or interacting with metadata files
                (e.g., database schemas, protocol formats).
                By generating code, you eliminate the need to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the metadata.

Refactoring Towards a Layered Architecture
        In this paper we present how refactoring of object-oriented programs can be accomplished by
        using formal refinement. Our approach is based on the use of refactoring rules designed for a
        sequential object-oriented language of refinement (rool) similar to Java. We define a strategy
        that aims at structuring programs according to a layered architecture that involves the application
        of refactoring rules, object-oriented programming laws, and data and algorithm refinement. As the
        laws are proved in a weakest precondition semantics of rool, correctness of refactoring is ensured
        by construction.
